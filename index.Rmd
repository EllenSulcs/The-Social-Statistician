Let Me Introduce Myself {.tabset}

I’m currently working at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield as a Data Scientist, a role where I spend my time helping the company visualize and understand their data. Occasionally, I apply my statistics degree and create models that help predict consumers’ actions and preferences. When I'm passionate about my work, I am able to tap into my creative side and stretch myself to apply the cool methodologies I learn about at conferences or on my favorite blogs. While I'm content to plug-in and code, my ideal job would involve opportunities to be productive without being in front of my computer all day long. 

My specialty is statistical modeling and visualization using R. Professionally, I work like the open source community does: I’m collaborative and always happy to share data and solutions to help all areas of the business. I feel a company benefits most from employees who are willing to share solutions; I'm learning to suppress my slightly competitive tendencies. Though technical by training, I often find myself presenting to the C-Suite, senior leadership and/or external clients. Initially these situations would cause some anxiety, however I've learned to truly enjoy this aspect of my job. Recently, I had the best time guest-lecturing MBA students about how to analyze and visualize Twitter data using R and the Twitter API.

I’m interested in working for a data-driven organization where I have the opportunity to work with colleagues who implement strategy based on more than a gut-feeling. I thrive in an environment that embraces change and empowers employees to develop innovative solutions. For me, this includes designated time to upskill and continue my education. An agile environment is important to me as I can grow impatient dealing with corporate bureaucracy.

If your company is a good fit for me and has an opening that will highlight my skills, contact me via email at ellen.cretekos@gmail.com or by phone at (914) 489-1010.  I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities.

Work Experience {.tabset}
===================================== 

**Data Scientist**  
*Excellus BlueCross BlueShield* (May 2016 - Present)

**Primary Responsibilities**  
Work with stakeholders across departments to support business decision making and guide strategy through data wrangling, predictive analytics and visualization. 

**Key Projects**

1. <span style="color:blue">Assess Commercial and Medicare Delinquency</span>  
Used Facets billing data to quantify the number of delinquent dollars received annually from our commercial groups and to identify individual groups who account for the largest percentage of delinquent dollars. Repeated this process with our Medicare line of business and demonstrated that it is most cost-effective to write-off late premiums instead of terminating delinquent members.  

2. <span style="color:blue">Predict Members Likely to File a Grievance with the Healthplan</span>   
Identify members likely to file a grievance based on demographic, call center, claims/utilization and billing data. Grievances are associated with lower quality ratings which translate to lower reimbursment rates. Outbound call campaigns are now used to target members likely to file a grievance in an attempt to improve the customer experience and prevent the need for the consumer to file a grievance.

3. <span style="color:blue">Enhance Transparency of Billing Error Log through Visualization</span>  
Create a "report" to summarize the type, frequncy and age of the billing errors Facets produces every night. R Flexdashboard was used to create a visualization that could be refreshed daily. The report enables the Membership & Billing department to identify subscribers and groups who are configured incorrectly so that membership data can be updated.

**Management Consultant**  
*Excellus BlueCross BlueShield* (June 2013 - May 2016)

**Primary Responsibilities**  
Designed and executed primary (survey) research including Employer Group and Broker stakeholder loyalty research.  

**Key Projects**

1. <span style="color:blue">Employer Group Loyalty Research</span>    
Conducted and reported on customer satisfaction research with the healthplan's employer groups on a quarterly basis. Created a dashboard view of the loyalty results including YTD and YOY results. Identified the key product and experience attributes that drive loyalty among commercial groups. Worked with Sales & Marketing to set appropriate goals for group satisfaction and prioritize strategic initiatives.  

2. <span style="color:blue">Medication Adherence Primary Research</span>  
Designed and implemented a survey to obtain first-hand perspective on the barriers that exist between patients and their treatments. Medication adherence is a quality metric for the healthplan that drives reimbursement amounts. This survey identified barriers to adherence as well as strategies patients use to take their medications as directed. The resarch resulted in targeted physician and member communication campaign surrounding taking medication as directed.  

3. <span style="color:blue">Medicare Direct Pay Focus Groups</span>  
Understand the member experience regarding the annual enrollment period (AEP) and any pain points with the communications they receive surrounding this process. Developed a discussion guide to extract consumer insights regarding product brochures and retail space.  Facilitated the focus groups and created a report outlining member perspectives and the need for quantitative research. This project helped create a business case for the investment into an Insight Community.

### Professional Skills

<span style="color:blue">*Project Management*</span>  
In my tenure at Harris Interactive I was responsible for scheduling and coordinating all internal operations associated with online research (survey programming, fielding, data processing, reporting). I also managed and trained junior level researchers to assist with day-to-day tasks.

More recently I have been involved in defining objectives and requirements for analytic projects. I also identify and work cross-functionally with various business owners needed to support the analytic projects (IT, Solution Architecture, Treasury Operations, etc.).

<span style="color:blue">*Communication*</span>  
I have extensive experience developing reports that concisely summarize research findings and provide actionable insight. In my Management Consulting role and currently in my Data Science role I routinely deliver presentations to our C-suite and senior leadership. I also recently gave a lecture at the Saunders College of Business at RIT on using R for visualization and sentiment analysis using the Twitter API.  

Additionally, I have completed courses in professional and technical writing and have co-authored three publications.

<span style="color:blue">*Collaboration*</span>  
I frequently work with various departments and subsidiaries to understand their business needs and design research/analytics to answer business questions and direct research.  I lead our internal R-Users group to encourage employees to get their feet wet with R and help them get started. I also actively participate in our local R-Users group through Meetup.  


On a More Personal Level
=====================================

### About ME

**The College Years**  
My journey began as a clueless college student who chose to pursue a technical degree because her parents thought she'd be good at it. They were right! But the undergraduate path I chose was not a great fit. Mechanical engineering requires some type of spatial sense that I just don't have.  I was advised (again, by my parents) to just finish the degree and use post-graduate education to determine a better career path. While in my B.S. program I discovered that I did enjoy learning about biomedical device development and health policy; this guided the grad-school application process.  

Not ready to face the real world, I chose to attend the University of Rochester's PhD program in Health Services Research and Policy after graduation. Within the first year I knew I wasn't cut out for work in academia. The endless grant writing and less than helpful faculty drove me to find a job, quit the program and figure it out from there.  

**The Early Career Years**  
I got my first real, non-internship, job in 2010 and Harris Interactive doing pharmaceutical market research. It was awesome. I picked up the market research process and operations quickly and really enjoyed my colleagues. Eventually I got a little bored and decided I needed to develop my analytic skills to advance my research reporting abilities. As researchers, we had access to SPSS but I had no idea what to do with it so in 2011 I started my Masters degree in Applied Statistics.  

I have reaped countless benefits from completing that degree. The program was challenging and I gained skills I could actually apply at my job. I learned about many statistical techniques and, most importantly, learned how to use R. The open-source community opened my eyes to the power of collaboration and really impacted the way I approach my job. Unfortunately Harris couldn't offer more technical work and kept blaming the economy for cutting benefits and non-existent raises.

**The Present**  
I started to check out other options in the Rochester area and ended up at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield. They have been a great employer the past 3+ years and have always made me feel valued. I recently transitioned to the Data Science team in an effort to branch out from survey research. I've had to up my data wrangling skills (thanks Coursera!) - it's amazing how all my graduate-school projects dealt with relatively clean data.

While I love to nerd-out, I also value getting away from my computer screen. In my free time I really enjoy traveling - my husband and I try to explore someplace new each year. My most recent adventures include trips to New Zealand, Colorado and Utah. And I'm really looking forward to hitting up Whistler in March!

Outside of the office, I spend my time hiking our pups (Doppler and Newton), getting my exercise at Crossfit and snowboarding. I recently decided to try my hand at gardening - it is a work in progress - Newton keeps stealing my vegetables.

### FAQs

***

**Are you open to positions outside of Rochester, NY?**  
*Yes! Finding a company that is data-driven and compatable with my working style is my top priority.*

**Do you feel qualified for management roles even though you have no management experience?**  
*Again, yes! Though I have limited direct management experience (yes, I'm counting the summer intern I managed as experience), I do have a lot of experience in leadership roles. Including:*

*1. Leading the R-Users Group at Excellus BCBS. I have worked hard to introduce the business to solutions other than SAS. This group meets monthly to share cool R creations. Since R is very new to Excellus, this group primarily consists of me sharing dashboards and analyses that I put together using R. I also help my colleagues get started using R and decide if the software is a good fit for their internal projects.*
    
*2. Managing our summer intern. I value the mentorship I receive at work and spent a lot of the summer helping her develop some R programming skills and explore various career options that could be available to her upon graduation.*
    
*3. Captain of the RIT Women's Crew Team (2005 - 2007, member starting in 2003). I lead the women's team it's first championship win and to competition in the nationally recognized Women's Royal Henley Regatta in England.*

**You have only worked in healthcare, are you open to opportunities in other industries?**  
*Yup. While I do enjoy working in healthcare, my skills are directly applicable to many other fields.  My passions include traveling and showing up to open houses to check out others' kitchens - so something in the travel or real-estate space would be awesome, but I'm open to anything. The only thing I can't justify is spending countless hours recommending the best advertisements to push to consumers while they peruse the internet.*

**Your email address says Ellen Cretekos while you introduce yourself as Ellen Sulcs, what's up with that?**  
*I'm married, my married name is Sulcs and it just doens't feel necessary to change my email address.*
